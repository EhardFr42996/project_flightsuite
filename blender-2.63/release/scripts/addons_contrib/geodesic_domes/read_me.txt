PKHG (did the conversion)
BIG change after revision 2551 GUI adjusted ...
You should download anew if older then 24-november-2011

In principle all parts work:
the *hedrons with superformparameters
Grid ... Sphere with superformparameters
Faces  **
Hubs   **
Struts **

** means will be adjusted ... at the moment you  have to name objects and
execute eventually again ;-( ...

but PKHG is content with a this nearly 95% converted version.

TODO, ranges of parameters could be chosen differently. Inform PKHG!

Uplaod will be done today (25-11 at about 19.30... GMT -+1)

_259 in the names is not important ... but let it be so (now) ;-)
